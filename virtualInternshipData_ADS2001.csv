33,a,1157,PESPVP,I would recomend using the the hydrophilic surfactant because it had a high flux at 5 and a realatively high rate which are desirable. It also had the second lowest cost ($235).

41,b,1657,PMMA,agreed,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
41,b,1658,PMMA,we need to decide on a process,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
40,b,1659,PMMA,Yes. The 4.0 CNT has a larger flux,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8
42,b,1660,PMMA,"That's the main point of difference, the process",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8
40,b,1661,PMMA,So we could pair it with a cheaper manufacturing process with lower flux perhaps,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,14
43,b,1662,PMMA,The dry jet is the cheapest process.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
40,b,1663,PMMA,I'm thinking of membrane fouling not flux,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
43,b,1664,PMMA,The dry-jet process also has a higher reliability,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8
41,b,1665,PMMA,Dry-Jet also has a good reactivity and 5 hours to 75% performance is not bad,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,15
41,b,1666,PMMA,"the other option, in my opinion, would be phase inversion",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10

43,b,1668,PMMA,So our two options for process are dry-jet and phase inversion?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,11

41,b,1674,PMMA,i agree with Clint,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4
43,b,1675,PMMA,So we could have phase inversion with 2% and 4% CNT with two options,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,14

69,c,2768,PRNLT,"1.As soon as you submit a notebook to Alex he will review it and then send feedback as soon as he can. While you are waiting, you should assist any of your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable. Your team will not be able to move on to the next task until each of your team members' notebooks have been witnessed.



2.Once Alex receives your notebook you should receive an email with feedback shortly thereafter. I recommend completing any notebook revisions or helping your teammates finish their deliverables while you wait for his feedback. As soon as all of your team's deliverables have been submitted and witnessed, you can get started on the next task.



3.After you've submitted a notebook and are waiting for feedback from Alex, you should help any of your teammates who haven't submitted their deliverable yet. You could also wrap up notebook revisions you didn't have time to finish earlier. If you still have time before your team meeting, you may want to start working on the final presentation that you will be giving at the end of the internship. You can find an outline of what Alex expects from your presentations in the resource section of Workpro. I recommend that you start working on the background research section of the presentation now.



4.Alex received your notebook and plans on sending some feedback soon. While you wait, revise unfinished notebooks or check to see if your teammates need help completing this deliverable. Once Alex has witnessed the deliverables of everyone on your team, you can all move on to the next task together.



5.Once you've submitted a notebook please assist your teammates who haven't completed the deliverable yet while you wait for the next task. You should also try to complete any outstanding notebooks that still need revisions. Any extra time you have should be spent working on your final presentation. The outline you're expected to follow for your presentations  is located in the resources section of workpro. Now would be a good time to research on the current state of dialysis technology.



6.After you submit a notebook Alex will send you an email with some feedback. While you wait for that email, remember to check and see if your teammates need any assistance. You should also make sure that you've revised incomplete notebooks from previous tasks. Alex won't let your team move forward until he has received a notebook from each of your teammates.



7.Alex wanted me to inform you of a few things you can do after you submit a notebook. You can help your teammates complete their deliverables, revise incomplete notebooks, or work on your presentation. Your presentation should include everything on the presentation outline, which is located in the resources section of Workpro. You may want to consider doing some research on design challenges about developing a dialyzer.



8.Once you've submitted a notebook for the current task, you can expect a response from Alex regarding the quality of your notebook. Until that email arrives, assist your teammates in completing their deliverables or check to make sure you have revised any notebooks Alex has sent back to you. Once everyone on your team has submitted their notebooks, Alex will send you the next task.

9.If you complete your notebook early, there are a few things you should consider doing. You should ask your teammates if they need any help completing their deliverables and complete any of your own notebooks that still need revisions. You should also think about working on your final presentation. In the resources section of Workpro, you can use the presentation outline document to get started on your preparation.



10.If you've completed your notebook and are waiting for the next task you should help your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable yet and work on revising any incomplete notebooks you may have. Also, If you have time before you meet with your new project team, you can work on your final presentation. Use the presentation outline from the resources section of Workpro to guide your preparation.



11.If you've completed your notebook and are waiting for Alex's next task, check to see if your teammates need any help and make sure you're up to date on revisions. Once everyone is finished with this notebook, Alex will send your team its next task



12.Alex stopped by and told me about a few things you can do if you've already submitted a notebook for the current task. You should start by checking to see if your teammates need any help finishing their deliverables or finishing any of your incomplete deliverables. If there's still time before your next meeting, you may want to start working on the references for your final project. It will be useful to reference the presentation outline which can be found in the resources section.



13.After you've submitted a notebook for this deliverable, a feedback email will arrive shortly thereafter. While you wait, ask your teammates if they need any assistance with their deliverables and check to make sure that you are caught up on your deliverable revisions. Alex will only give his next task after everyone has submitted their notebooks.



14.For those of you who are finishing up your notebooks early, Alex gave me a few things you should get started on. While you wait for your next task, you should help your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable yet. Also, make sure that you are up to speed on your own tasks. |4s|If you have time before you meet with your project team, you can also work on your final presentation. I recommend collecting your teams specifications, descriptions, justifications for design choices, and potential limitations for your final prototype. You should also describe which consultants requests your design met and those it did not. |3s|The presentation outline document is a useful tool you can use to see what topics you still need to complete with your teammates before you present.



15.After submitting a notebook, Alex will send you some feedback as quickly as he can. While you wait, it would be great if you could make sure you have revised incomplete notebooks. Once everyone on your team has completed this task, he will send you the final task of your internship.",2,Player,Introduction and Workflow Tutorial with Entrance Interview,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1032

68,c,3070,PRNLT,well I thought we were sticking to just using bio and steric... and dry and vapor,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,16

65,c,3074,PRNLT,But hydro is both cheaper and boosts reliability more than negative charge,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,12

64,c,3145,PRNLT,I believe it was a successful trial. It showed us that the performance of these designs were high but that the cost was well above our goal,2,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,27

67,c,3152,PRNLT,Well with higher levels of CNT there is a higher cost due to more technology.,2,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,15
64,c,3153,PRNLT,I agree higher percent CNT related to a higher cost,2,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,10

65,c,3159,PRNLT,"Ya, I agree Allison. There's going to be some tradeoff between cost and efficiency. But with the higher efficiency, we also see a higher marketability.

74,c,3281,PMMA,"Agreed. None performed best in every one, but steric hindering performed very well overall.

71,c,3295,PMMA,I think we should at least narrow it down to the two most important factors. Low blood cell reactivity is probably the most important to patient comfort.

74,c,3380,PMMA,Second lowest what?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,3
72,c,3381,PMMA,hydrophilic has a percentage of 63.2%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
74,c,3382,PMMA,Negative charge and steric hindering are 50.8% and 50.2%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9
72,c,3383,PMMA,Reason for going with 4% nanotube?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6
74,c,3384,PMMA,Just because it was the highest percentage that I could see data for and therefore the highest I could trust 100%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,21
71,c,3385,PMMA,We should think about CNT% too because with PMMA we only need 1% to get us to a flux rate of 22 and it statys constant after that,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,28
71,c,3386,PMMA,The more CNTs we include the more expensive each unit will be,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,12
70,c,3387,PMMA,True but CNTs also increase reliability,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
74,c,3388,PMMA,And marketability,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2
71,c,3389,PMMA,what's the difference in reliability between a unit with 1% and 4%?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,12
72,c,3390,PMMA,Alright how about this. We go with the biological surfactant with a low cnt % since the blood cell reactivity is already low,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,23
74,c,3391,PMMA,So are you talking about making a new prototype then?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,10
72,c,3392,PMMA,this keeps the device at a decent price while making it more marketable,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13
72,c,3393,PMMA,"not necessarily, just decrease the cnt%",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
71,c,3394,PMMA,I think that reasoning is sound. We've got 5 prototypes to submit so we can run with a few ideas,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,20
70,c,3395,PMMA,Ok so do we need to make a new prototype(s) or stick with the ones already made?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,17

71,c,3397,PMMA,We can use some of the prototypes in the shared space unless we want to compromise on all of them?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,20

74,c,3399,PMMA,We can talk about it. We might not need to compromise on some.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,13
71,c,3400,PMMA,I agree,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2
71,c,3401,PMMA,I think we should include at least one high CNT% model to see how it compares to the others,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,19
70,c,3402,PMMA,Im thinking we should use Tressa's affordability and reliability prototypes,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,10
70,c,3403,PMMA,Thats a good idea David,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5

71,c,3406,PMMA,So we've got three down,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5
73,c,3407,PMMA,So do we want to try a reactivity model,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,9
73,c,3408,PMMA,?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,1
74,c,3409,PMMA,Yes I think that would be a good idea,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9
72,c,3410,PMMA,lets make the reactivity one with the highest cnt %,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10
71,c,3411,PMMA,Let's use the model with the lowest BCR and either Tressa's marketability model or Jared's PMMA model,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,17
71,c,3412,PMMA,Or we can brainstorm a new high CNT% model,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,9
74,c,3413,PMMA,I like Jared's PMMA model,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5
73,c,3414,PMMA,What are we trying to see with the CNT% flux or reactivity?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,12
74,c,3415,PMMA,We haven't used one with Phase Inversion yet,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8
74,c,3416,PMMA,%CNT does not affect blood cell reactivity,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,7
73,c,3417,PMMA,not reactivity flux.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3
70,c,3418,PMMA,So lets make a new one to be the 5th one that uses Phase Inversion so we can test that out,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,21
72,c,3419,PMMA,but increases permeablility to decrease wait time,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

72,c,3421,PMMA,sounds good to me,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

70,c,3423,PMMA,Oh ok so should we use mine for the phase inversion or make another?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,14

74,c,3428,PMMA,What is the goal of Jared's PMMA model?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,8
73,c,3429,PMMA,The only surfactant worth changing it too would be hydrophilic if we wanted a higher reliability.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,16
72,c,3430,PMMA,I think we're good. we're trying to make the most efficient device within budget.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14

87,c,4293,PESPVP,Well we need two more prototypes so why don't we just use negative charge and hydrophilic? None of the prototypes are going to be absolutely perfect.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,26

85,c,4338,PESPVP,"So, prototype 1 was very marketable, medium cost, decent flux, and decent reliability",6,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,13
87,c,4339,PESPVP,It seems that number one did well with the exceptions that the cost did not meet the manufacturing engineers request and the BCR did not meet the clinical engineer's request,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,30

86,c,4355,PESPVP,"I think prototype 1 was a good baseline prototype to compare the rest of them to.

86,c,4361,PESPVP,I'm hoping the prototypes tried by the others in my new team will be varied enough that we can see the differences without being so different that we have no idea what made the difference in each category.

85,c,4395,PESPVP,I was also factoring out like the effects of things other than the material,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,14
86,c,4396,PESPVP,It isn't bad but it is a little high. I think other teams will end up with lower BCRs so PESPVP does not have that going for it necessarily,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,29
87,c,4397,PESPVP,Exactly what I thought,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4

96,d,4748,PMMA,"I chose that because it looked to me like it had a larger colored space from the graph and the best marketability, so even if it cost more than negative charge it would be easier to sell, making it a little easier to make up that extra money.",3,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,48

97,d,4841,PMMA,alright,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
99,d,4842,PMMA,so how do we want to go about which 5 we want to submit?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,14
97,d,4843,PMMA,"Ok I think phase, negative and 2% device should select because everyone chose it.",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,14
96,d,4844,PMMA,"Good idea. Besides PMMA, are there any variables you guys don't want to test and change?",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,16
98,d,4845,PMMA,That would make sense. We all agreed on that surfactant and the data showed 2% and above had the same affect on flux,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,23
100,d,4846,PMMA,"well which thing do we want to focus on testing? The process, surfactant or nanotube?",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,15
99,d,4847,PMMA,i think we should keep nanotubes at 2%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8
98,d,4848,PMMA,When it is 4% the reliability went up. I think that is worth looking at,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,15
96,d,4849,PMMA,I agree with Logan,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4
100,d,4850,PMMA,My thought was do each process at 2 % then we could try 4 % for a few too,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,19
99,d,4851,PMMA,yeah but it depends which attributes we are looking at?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,10
97,d,4852,PMMA,yeah me too,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3
98,d,4853,PMMA,I think at least one or two should be 4%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,10
98,d,4854,PMMA,Change the process on those maybe,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6
99,d,4855,PMMA,that sounds fine,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3
96,d,4856,PMMA,That makes sense. Do we want to mess around with the surfactants or just pick one for all the trials?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,20
97,d,4857,PMMA,but resources showed the best is 2% right?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,8
100,d,4858,PMMA,We could do 2% on each process then 4% on vapor and dry jet because we haven't seen those go together yet at all,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,24
99,d,4859,PMMA,depends on what you look at,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
97,d,4860,PMMA,Okay.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
98,d,4861,PMMA,After 2% the flux doesn't go up with the nanotubs,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,10
99,d,4862,PMMA,from a reliability stand point it increases but from a cost stand point its not a significant enough change to probably warrant the cost increase,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,25
100,d,4863,PMMA,4% offered a higher fouling resistance,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
99,d,4864,PMMA,so i guess what we need to decide is what attribute we want to look at most and go from there,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,21
100,d,4865,PMMA,I agree,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2
98,d,4866,PMMA,Kirk made a good point. We could test with 4% but the cost might not be justifiable,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,17
98,d,4867,PMMA,We haven't mentioned changing the surfactant to steric hindering,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9
99,d,4868,PMMA,that was gonna be my first suggestion earlier,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8

100,d,4872,PMMA,We need five devices to generate a new batch right?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,10
99,d,4873,PMMA,i think if we use the one pelikankanamalage mentioned,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,9
99,d,4874,PMMA,then change the surfactant to steric,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
99,d,4875,PMMA,thats 2 devices,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3
97,d,4876,PMMA,i think we should change surfactants,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,6
99,d,4877,PMMA,then maybe change another attribute on each and thats 2 more,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,11
98,d,4878,PMMA,We could do the different phases with the negative and two phases with the steric hindering.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,16

97,d,4886,PMMA,I mean good idea,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4
96,d,4887,PMMA,So we are keeping the CNT constant now?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,8
97,d,4888,PMMA,yep,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
99,d,4889,PMMA,i think that would be best,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
99,d,4890,PMMA,at 2%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2
98,d,4891,PMMA,Yes. the increase in fouling resistance does not justify the cost it takes to add more.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,16
96,d,4892,PMMA,"Ok. So we want to do all three processes with PMMA at 2% CNT, three with steric and two with negative?",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,21
96,d,4893,PMMA,And switch processes between those?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,5
98,d,4894,PMMA,I think along those lines. Just need to choose whichever surfactant we want to test with the three proccesses,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,19
100,d,4895,PMMA,I think negative charge and steric hindrance,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
99,d,4896,PMMA,yeah im ok with with either steric with all three and negative with 2 or vice versa,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,17
100,d,4897,PMMA,do three with negative charge,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5
100,d,4898,PMMA,that was my thought at least,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
96,d,4899,PMMA,"ok, well from our last discussion everyones favorite was negative charge, so why don't we do all three with that and two with steric hindrance",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,25
97,d,4900,PMMA,so someone should make a new batch and upload it. then others can do the same. Is this a good idea?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,21

103,d,5231,PSF,I'm pretty sure 1% is the best,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7
103,d,5232,PSF,in any case,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3
102,d,5233,PSF,yes i agree,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3
105,d,5234,PSF,"ya, 1% is better",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4

102,d,5236,PSF,what do you guys think?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,5
103,d,5237,PSF,that's right.,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2

102,d,5239,PSF,i don't know if the difference in flux rate is that significant,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,12
102,d,5240,PSF,"but the standard is 10 anyways, so if we take the last one it will cost less",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,17
103,d,5241,PSF,"yes,",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

102,d,5248,PSF,any ideas on what should our second prototype be?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,9

102,d,5255,PSF,i really think we should stick with either steric hindrance or negative charge surfactants since they are the average..,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,19
102,d,5256,PSF,this way we would only worry about manufacturing process,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9

102,d,5274,PSF,stephen it is only mentioned in the device speculation,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9

102,d,5276,PSF,but for the third prototype i would suggest changing the process not surfactant because going with other surfactant will increase cost or will decrease cost with reliability,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,27

107,d,5777,PESPVP,"Based on your surfactant graph, how did the surfactants perform relative to one another?",6,Mentor,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,14
116,d,5778,PESPVP,Almost every surfactant had an advantage in a particular area.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
113,d,5779,PESPVP,Using the graph the best one for use would be Steric hindering is what i got.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,16
114,d,5780,PESPVP,The No surfactant performed the worst and Hydrophillic and Steric Hindering surfactants were two of the best.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,17
107,d,5781,PESPVP,Was there one surfactant that was obviously the best choice?,6,Mentor,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,10
115,d,5782,PESPVP,I agree with Gregory. They all have advantages and disadvantages.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,10
114,d,5783,PESPVP,"I agree Nickolas, the Steric Hindering Surfactant was the best.",6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
113,d,5784,PESPVP,I found that steric hindering was best based off marketability and the over usefulness. though the cost was second highest,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,20
116,d,5785,PESPVP,I found hydrophilic to be the best in terms of reliability,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,11
115,d,5786,PESPVP,I think the hydrophilic surfactant is the best choice,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9
113,d,5787,PESPVP,Same with hydrophilic and the no surfact was the cheapest,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,10

107,d,5795,PESPVP,How did you choose the best surfactant?,6,Mentor,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,7
113,d,5796,PESPVP,I based mine more off marketability towards the end between hydrophilic and steric. The more marketable it is the more a company will want to produce it.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,27
114,d,5797,PESPVP,I added the numbers for each Surfactant to determine the ones with the highest ratings and chose Steric Hindering over Hydrophillic because it had higher ratings in the more important categories.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,31
116,d,5798,PESPVP,I began by eliminating options that had too many negatives and decided between the remainder by figuring out which one had good overall ratings,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,24
107,d,5799,PESPVP,Did you value some attributes more than others when choosing the best surfactant?,6,Mentor,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,13
115,d,5800,PESPVP,I valued more the reliability  attribute than the other ones. I thought it would be easier for us to improve other attributes than the reliability.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,25
113,d,5801,PESPVP,I valued all equally but went with marketability in the end,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,11
114,d,5802,PESPVP,I valued Marketability because it is all about the customer in the end,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,13

114,d,5805,PESPVP,Yes,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
115,d,5806,PESPVP,So we can make it more marketable,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,7
116,d,5807,PESPVP,"Yes Justin, that's the process I used.",6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7

113,d,5810,PESPVP,Though you can make it more marketable there are ways to make it more reliable. I went off a right this moment decision not a future one,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,27
107,d,5811,PESPVP,What will you need to do to improve the design of the filtration membrane?,6,Mentor,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,14
113,d,5812,PESPVP,Next step would be coming to some kind of decision,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,10
114,d,5813,PESPVP,We should do more research to better understand the surfactants and their attributes in order to be confident in our choice of surfactant,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,23
115,d,5814,PESPVP,Sure! I thought it would be easier to make a surfactant more marketable than to make it more reliable.,6,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,19

113,d,5886,PESPVP,Why VDP and DryJet,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4
115,d,5887,PESPVP,It's reliable for the hydro. It has a high flux rate for the 20.0 % CNT and VDP. It also has a great hydrophilicity for both hydro and CNT on PESPVP.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,31

118,e,6120,PRNLT,I did the same thing as Patrick. I also made sure that the surfactant I picked had each of the attributes and wasn't lacking any of the attributes.

125,e,6469,PMMA,"I do see your point, so perhaps just steric and hydrophilic",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,11
124,e,6470,PMMA,True. Maybe add a third hydrophilic or steric and then use the three of those to test the three processes?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,20
125,e,6471,PMMA,"I would say a third hydrophilic, and you could do the three different CNT % as well",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,17
128,e,6472,PMMA,"Maybe we should do 3 tests at 6% CNT, and two of them with the same surfactant, then just vary the manufacturing process?",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,1,0,0,0,4,23

I don't really have that information (as you already know) and he also said that I was supposed to turn it in by 8am today... well I got on here yesterday afternoon/evening and there wasn't anything sent back to me yet.

136,e,6972,PAM,the same thing but with 4% CNT?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,7
138,e,6973,PAM,"yeah, only change one constant for the last one i think",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,11
135,e,6974,PAM,I thin we should test Dry-Jet process too though right?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,10
135,e,6975,PAM,we haven't done any with that.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6

138,e,6977,PAM,so can we pick between dry-jet and 4%?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,8
135,e,6978,PAM,I think we should do dry-jet with 4%,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,8

137,e,6980,PAM,What is the surfactant for that one again?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,8
135,e,6981,PAM,"Or we cold try phase with 4%? Because phase has the worst reliability by far, but the 4% could help improve that while keeping a really high flux.",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,28
138,e,6982,PAM,"well, i think dry jet will do better with 2% than 4%, beause the weakest attribute of dry-jet is flux",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,20
135,e,6983,PAM,I agree with that. Did you say what I mentioned about maybe trying a different variation with the phase process?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,20
135,e,6984,PAM,Just an idea. I know we only have one left and we haven't tried Dry-Jet so I'm good with either option...,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,21
138,e,6985,PAM,yeah I am cool with the idea of switching one of the  phase to 4%,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,15
135,e,6986,PAM,What does everyone else think of that?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,7
138,e,6987,PAM,the ones we did with phase were 1 and 4 right?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,11
135,e,6988,PAM,1 and 2. The only thing we changed was the surfactant on those two.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,14
138,e,6989,PAM,"oh, ok!",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2
137,e,6990,PAM,And now we're thinking we should also change the CNT% along with the surfactant?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,14
136,e,6991,PAM,What were the surfactants on those two again?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,8

135,e,6997,PAM,I was thinking Phase with 4%. That would be highest flux process with highest reliability CNT%.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,16
138,e,6998,PAM,with both surfactants though?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,4
135,e,6999,PAM,No just one of them.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5
136,e,7000,PAM,Well I would like to see the difference that the surfactant makes alone on the first 2.  So yeah we could probably do 4% with one of the phase ones.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,30
135,e,7001,PAM,I think steric hindrance. it would help improve the poor blood cell reactivity.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,13

135,e,7007,PAM,ok,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
135,e,7008,PAM,should we do phase with 4% CNT?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,7

181,g,8672,PMMA,It appears that the most commonly chosen surfactant was the negative charge. I think we should have at least one and possible multiple prototypes testing variations with that surfactant.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,29

181,g,8678,PMMA,so the Dry-Jet Wet Printing process was the most inexpensive one. Going off of what was said previously one prototype would be negative charge and dry-jet. What do you guys think about the nanotube %?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,1,0,5,35

181,g,8693,PMMA,I feel that since we determined negative charge and steric hindering to be the two with the most potential maybe we should try to get a wider range of data within the other variables for these surfactants. we could have one prototype be another surfactant but the other two I think should still be negative charge and steric hindering. let me know if your thoughts differ.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,66
182,g,8694,PMMA,"I agree with patrick, we agreed that steric hindering or negative charge would be the best so we should compare them with our device prototypes.",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,0,0,1,0,5,25

179,g,8696,PMMA,I agree and wouldn't mind just using only negative charge and steric hindrance as the surfactants for all 5 prototypes,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20
181,g,8697,PMMA,okay so let's see what other information we can acquire with the next 2 prototypes and if we feel that is enough then we can make the 5th have a different surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,32
181,g,8698,PMMA,it will just be hard to interpret one data point for a particular surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,14
181,g,8699,PMMA,"For me, I thought that blood cell reactivity should be a major concern since this is what determined how well the customers rated the device in the surveys - aka marketability.

179,g,8700,PMMA,Okay lets do that for the third one then,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9
182,g,8701,PMMA,i'd be okay with that for our third prototype as well.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,11
181,g,8702,PMMA,So essentially in order to do that we would be using the vapor-deposition polymerization which is also the most expensive process.

181,g,8704,PMMA,should we use that arrangement for negative charge or steric hindering or both? any reasoning for one or the other?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,20
181,g,8705,PMMA,I think that both would be a good idea but I'm up for other ideas.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,15
182,g,8706,PMMA,"I'm thinking negative charge, because it is cheaper and has almost the same blood cell reactivity as the steric hindering. But then again the steric hindering is more marketable, so we could do both",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,34
181,g,8707,PMMA,hmm.. fair reasoning. definitely do negative charge. and I am on board for doing steric hindering as well. Any other thoughts?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,21

181,g,8710,PMMA,If we wanted to throw a wildcard out there we could try something with the phase inversion process.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,18
181,g,8711,PMMA,It has the highest flux rate but worst time to 75% performance so I think we'd have to use a larger CNT % to make up for the quick fouling rate,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,31

Reflection on Design Process:



Our prototypes resulted in a lot similar results. Unfortunately one of our best designs turned out to be too expensive, however Phase Inversion at 2% seemed to be our best design. But it's cost may too high leaving only Phase Inversion at 1.5% as our best option to proceed with. It has a profit margin, high marketability and flux, low blood cell reactivity, and though its reliability is not the most ideal it is more than serviceable.",5,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,355

Process:  Vapor Deposition Polymerization



Surfactant:  Biological



Nanotube %:  2





Justification:



This design aims to maximize both flux and blood cell reactivity.  The manufacturing process of vapor deposition polymerization maximizes flux in comparison to the other manufacturing options of phase inversion and dry-jet wet printing.  In addition, the biological surfactant has the best blood cell reactivity out of all of the surfactant choices. Finally, 2% carbon nanotube in this prototype also aids in maximizing flux.",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,71

228,i,10627,PRNLT,i agree with the 10%,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5
233,i,10628,PRNLT,10 % CNT is best,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5
230,i,10629,PRNLT,i think 10% has tested the best yeah,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8
231,i,10630,PRNLT,Jason - why did you choose 3% CNT,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,8

231,i,10634,PRNLT,I like 10% also it looks like it has reliabilty of at least 75% until 7 hours,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,17
230,i,10635,PRNLT,Yeah I used 10% because it says the highest flux rates are recorded with 10% CNT and the membrane fouling rate proves to be a little over 6 hours.,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,29
232,i,10636,PRNLT,yeah so I think by testing the surfactants we are just seeing about the reactivity and what that does to the flux.,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,22

228,i,10660,PRNLT,Okay so heres my idea since we cant agree on a manufacturing process. When we did research on surfactants we narrowed it to negative and hydrophillic(i think). so we test those and then the three processes,2,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,36

243,i,11402,PSF,So are you saying we should use 1.5 for prototypes 1-4 instead of 1.0?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,14
239,i,11403,PSF,yeah,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1

266,j,12491,PSF,Here is my justification:,4,Player,Individuals design 5 prototypes,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4
269,j,12492,PSF,"Used Phase Inversion because it wasn't the most expensive, and it had the highest initial flux rate, but had poor reliability.

266,j,12493,PSF,"The material is PSF because that is what our group is focused on. Vapor deposition polymerization and 4.0% inclusion gives the highest reliability rating. Also, the design has a hydrophilic surfactant because that one has the highest reliabiltiy and a low cost.",4,Player,Individuals design 5 prototypes,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,42
265,j,12494,PSF,"We chose the Phase Inversion process because it had the highest flux and lowest blood cell reactivity, which were both important aspects to Padma Rao.

267,j,12495,PSF,I used Dry-jet Wet because the cost was the lowest. I picked none for Surfactant because none had the lowest cost. The marketability Rudy wanted was to use nano tubes because it is new and appealing. I picked Nanotube % of 2.0 because it was in the middle of the others talked about in the group. Again no surfactant had a cost that varied that much.,4,Player,Individuals design 5 prototypes,0,1,0,1,1,0,5,66
268,j,12496,PSF,The phase inversion process was chosen because this process resulted in the lowest blood cell reactivity.

Based off of Alan DuChamp's recommendation for reliability, I recommend trying at 1.0%CNT to reach his desired standard of the device operating at 75% of its orginal value at the end of a 9 hour treatment.

295,k,13314,PAM,I thought Steric Hindering was the most practical,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,8
293,k,13315,PAM,Well from my findings the membrane with no surfacant preformed the worst in every test,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,15
294,k,13316,PAM,"I picked the negative charge surfactant, my reasoning being that it was the most well rounded and cost practical, so not the best overall but the best of the group.",5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,30
293,k,13317,PAM,I believed the negative charge surfacant was most practical because the price was lower and preformed almost identically to the Steric Hindering,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,22
294,k,13318,PAM,"@Zachary I agree, only upside was the cost.",5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8
293,k,13319,PAM,so you also agree it was the best for practical use?,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,11
295,k,13320,PAM,yeah I considered that too but the only reason I chose Steric Hindering over negative charge was because the marketability was so high,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,0,0,1,0,5,23
295,k,13321,PAM,so you would wind up making up for the cost being only slightly higher,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,14
296,k,13322,PAM,I also had the steric hindering surfactant,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7
293,k,13323,PAM,"thats a good point bridgid, I mainly took into account the price and results rather than the marketing because I thought that someone who is in need of this would want results and cost more than its ability to sell",5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,40

295,k,13327,PAM,okay so it comes down to if we'd rather focus on short term benefits or long term,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,17
293,k,13328,PAM,I believe that further testing would be helpful. i think we can all agree that the negative charge and the static Hindering were the best two options correct?,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,28
295,k,13329,PAM,yes it's definitely between the two of them,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,8
296,k,13330,PAM,agreed,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
294,k,13331,PAM,I agree with that. Narrowing down the surfactants would increase the extent of the testing we could do on them.,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,20
293,k,13332,PAM,Alright so for further tests I would suggest just testing those two in the same tests. The results on marketability may come out very differently if the options are narrowed down.,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,31
295,k,13333,PAM,exactly and I'm sure there are more things to consider outside of the 5 pieces of data we researched,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,19

293,k,13357,PAM,so witch designs do we wanna choose,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,7
293,k,13358,PAM,I think we should make new ones (considering how quick it is) based on some specifications we decide here,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,19

294,k,13362,PAM,I like that idea.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4
294,k,13363,PAM,Let's start with cost,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4
296,k,13364,PAM,That sounds good. I made mine so that I had one for each consultant and what they were looking for,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,20
293,k,13365,PAM,ok well why dont you guys go through and find the factors that result in the least cost and i will go make it,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,24
294,k,13366,PAM,I'll create the prototype in FEEDS,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
293,k,13367,PAM,ok well the most cost effective surfactant was no surfactant,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
295,k,13368,PAM,Is that practical though?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,4
293,k,13369,PAM,also CNT% had no affect on cost so we can choose whatever for that,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,14
294,k,13370,PAM,"So we need to chose the process, surfactant, and nanotube concentration",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,11
296,k,13371,PAM,Dry jet wet printing is best for cost,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8
295,k,13372,PAM,cheapest surfactant is hydrophilic,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4
295,k,13373,PAM,"if we dont consider ""no surfactant""",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,6
294,k,13374,PAM,I don't think that that is practical. I think we should chose jet wet.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,14
293,k,13375,PAM,"but this is overall cost, were not considering preformance",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9
293,k,13376,PAM,and alexandra is right dry jet is the least expensive,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
293,k,13377,PAM,then lets go with 2% CNT,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,6
294,k,13378,PAM,"Yes, however I don't think we should completely ignore performance.",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,10
293,k,13379,PAM,well then this isnt strictly a cost model,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8
295,k,13380,PAM,i still think we should choose a surfactant,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,8
293,k,13381,PAM,alright lets choose the cheapest one,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,6
294,k,13382,PAM,We have to keep in mind the goal of the product is still to perform.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,15
295,k,13383,PAM,i feel like no surfactant was just a comparison thing not an actual option,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,14
295,k,13384,PAM,hydro is cheapest,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3
293,k,13385,PAM,alright so the first one will  be \,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8
293,k,13386,PAM,#NAME?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1

295,k,13391,PAM,hydro again has the best reliability,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,6
293,k,13392,PAM,so this one is -hydro -vapor dep -4% CNT,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9
296,k,13393,PAM,yes,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
294,k,13394,PAM,Thats exactly what I was going to say,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8

293,k,13399,PAM,ok for the third one lets focus on flux,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9
296,k,13400,PAM,Phase inversion,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2
294,k,13401,PAM,I think % again because higher concentrations were clogging the pores,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,11
294,k,13402,PAM,2%*,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
293,k,13403,PAM,this one will be -phase inversion-2%CNT and -surfactant doesnt matter thay all had the same flux,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,16
296,k,13404,PAM,yeah,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
294,k,13405,PAM,So.. which one should we choose?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,6
295,k,13406,PAM,either negative or steric,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4
296,k,13407,PAM,uhh maybe the one for best reliability because it sort of effects flux,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,13
295,k,13408,PAM,thats a good point,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4
294,k,13409,PAM,I was thinking that two but they tied on that,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,10
293,k,13410,PAM,lets do hydro then,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,4
296,k,13411,PAM,i think hydro would be good,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6
294,k,13412,PAM,"I think we should go with steric, I think overall it's better, just more expensive, and we're not focusing on cost right now.",5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,23
293,k,13413,PAM,alright that sounds good too,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5
294,k,13414,PAM,Oh true,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2
294,k,13415,PAM,No let's do hydro,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,4
293,k,13416,PAM,it really doenst matter all that much for this specific condition,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,11
295,k,13417,PAM,I agree. We've already used hydro on the first 2 we should change it up,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,15
293,k,13418,PAM,alright use whatever you would like alexandra,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7

293,k,13421,PAM,so for the fourth lets concentrate on blood cell reactivity,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
296,k,13422,PAM,Phase inversion,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2
293,k,13423,PAM,we want biological for the surfactant,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
295,k,13424,PAM,biological is the best for that,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,6
294,k,13425,PAM,I don't think nanotubes have any effect,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
294,k,13426,PAM,so 4%?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,2
296,k,13427,PAM,yeah they dont,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3

293,k,13466,PAM,i actuallly think the one we built to be best all around preformed amazingly well. it had the higest flux as well,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,22

295,k,13473,PAM,yeah I agree. #2 shouldn't be considered the cost is nearing too high with a lower marketability. The flux is the worst out of all of them and the BCR isn't too great either.,5,Player,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,34

306,l,13772,PMMA,I recommend the steric hindering surfactant. The low blood cell relativity and the great marketability will make people more likely to take the procedure and pay the higher price. This will allow for more profitability for the company. The only problem is that it is not reliable.,3,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,47

329,m,15034,PSF,How did you guys go about deciding which specifications to use for your prototypes?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,14
330,m,15035,PSF,I looked at the last notebook entry,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7
330,m,15036,PSF,What process did you guys think was the most effective? I think we should stick to Vapor and Dry-jet Wet,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,20
331,m,15037,PSF,I think Dry-jet wet is the way to go,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9
329,m,15038,PSF,Phase did not seem to be a good choice,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9
331,m,15039,PSF,agreed,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
332,m,15040,PSF,I agree. I picked vapor and dry-jet wet as the more ideal manufacturing processes for my consultants,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,17
330,m,15041,PSF,Ok so phase is out.,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5
330,m,15042,PSF,I think we should use prototypes that have those two processes to see which one works better though.,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,18
329,m,15043,PSF,agreed,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
330,m,15044,PSF,So surfactant wise - what are you all thinking?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,9
331,m,15045,PSF,That's a good idea. We also said that steric hindering was the best surfactant option earlier right?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,17
330,m,15046,PSF,"Yes, agreed Lucas",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3

329,m,15048,PSF,"Yes, and the next best would be hydrophilic i think",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
330,m,15049,PSF,I think hydrophilic is also a good option though,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9
331,m,15050,PSF,So we can do 3 to 4 with steric hinderance and 1 to 2 with hydrophilic,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,16

330,m,15054,PSF,I think 1.5 is the best sption,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7
332,m,15055,PSF,1.5 and 2,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3
331,m,15056,PSF,1.5-2% was optimal for flux,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5
329,m,15057,PSF,Yeah I thought 1-1.5,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4

351,n,16235,PMMA,Do you mean as in each of the five consultants we looked at?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,13
350,n,16236,PMMA,Yes thats how I based my prototypes,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7
352,n,16237,PMMA,"Yeah, thats what I did too",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6
351,n,16238,PMMA,Ok I didn't base mine solely off those ideas personally,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10
350,n,16239,PMMA,Would we like to do that for the five we send through as well?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,14
350,n,16240,PMMA,How did you do it Alec?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,6
351,n,16241,PMMA,"I kinda used those as guidelines to keep in mind, but created prototypes that performed better at different things.",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19
351,n,16242,PMMA,I tried to make them somewhat similar too so we could compare them easily,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,14
352,n,16243,PMMA,We  could. I think we'll probably have to narrow down the number of designs so later on we could decide which of these categories we think is most important.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,29
350,n,16244,PMMA,Alright well then lets talk about what we want for prototypes im going to open my second window quick,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,19
351,n,16245,PMMA,I wouldn't disagree with using prototypes that meet each of their needs.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12
350,n,16246,PMMA,Alright it seems like the most straightforward way to me,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,10
351,n,16247,PMMA,"It should be easy to compare, because there will be so many crossovers among all categories",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,16
351,n,16248,PMMA,Ok lets do that then.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5
352,n,16249,PMMA,I like the idea for now. Later on we can choose which one we like best or combine parts of different designs,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,22
350,n,16250,PMMA,Yes hopefully,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2
351,n,16251,PMMA,Yeah thats true because the end goal here is to create a product that would meet all their needs to the best ability,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,23
351,n,16252,PMMA,Not one that caters to 2 categories or something,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9
350,n,16253,PMMA,Alright so what do we want to do? Because we all have to decide on the choice here,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,18
350,n,16254,PMMA,Like we have to go through all five and decide,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,10
351,n,16255,PMMA,For now lets make one prototype for each consultant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9
352,n,16256,PMMA,A lot of me and Will's designs look really similar or are the same,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,14
350,n,16257,PMMA,Alright so to start we can just look at our prototype number one,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,13
351,n,16258,PMMA,Lets all put our stuff in the shared space so we all can see,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,14
350,n,16259,PMMA,I have the Vapor process Biological Surfactant and 4.0%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,9
350,n,16260,PMMA,CNT,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
350,n,16261,PMMA,This for me matched up with Wayne Anderson,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8
352,n,16262,PMMA,This was also my design for Wayne,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7
351,n,16263,PMMA,I had one similar to that,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
350,n,16264,PMMA,Do we want to use this design as one or any changes you guys can think of>,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,17
350,n,16265,PMMA,?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,1
351,n,16266,PMMA,The only question I have in general is what is the price difference between 2% and 4% CNT,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18
352,n,16267,PMMA,There wasn't any difference mentioned but it would make sense that 4% would cost more,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,15
350,n,16268,PMMA,"They didnt have one. I know that confused me as well, but without a price i take it as no difference",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,21
351,n,16269,PMMA,Like could we cut some of the cost here by lowering that percentage,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13
352,n,16270,PMMA,"But Wayne Anderson also said he was looking for marketability and blood-cell reactivity, not price",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,15
350,n,16271,PMMA,"Maybe for a few, for Wayne I wouldnt recommend it as he was all about as many CNT as he can have",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,22
351,n,16272,PMMA,It seems like it would make sense that 4% would cost more. But as long as we don't know we csan stick with 4%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,24
350,n,16273,PMMA,Maria does CNT% affect price?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,5
351,n,16274,PMMA,Yeah i agree for this consultant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
350,n,16275,PMMA,Alright so that can be our first prototype agreed?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,9
351,n,16276,PMMA,Agreed,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
352,n,16277,PMMA,Yes,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
350,n,16278,PMMA,Alright,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
352,n,16279,PMMA,Ok how about the design for Alan DuChamp?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,8
350,n,16280,PMMA,I will write taht down quick,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
350,n,16281,PMMA,For Allen I had Dry jet printing and Hydrophilic Surfact,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,10
350,n,16282,PMMA,along with the always% CNT,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5
350,n,16283,PMMA,4,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
352,n,16284,PMMA,"I had Dry-jet wet, hydrophilic and 4% CNT. So the same for me again",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,14
350,n,16285,PMMA,Here is one guy if the CNT does cost more we could cut it down on,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,16
351,n,16286,PMMA,Yeah I think dry jet and hydrophilic are the way to go.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12
350,n,16287,PMMA,Since he only wants reliability and cheapness,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,7
352,n,16288,PMMA,Yes. I think if we find out that more CNT costs money then we cut down on the %,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,19
350,n,16289,PMMA,Alright so we agree on this design for the second one?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,11
350,n,16290,PMMA,and we can always cut CNT down later,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8
351,n,16291,PMMA,Yeah I agree.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3
352,n,16292,PMMA,"Yes, its good unless we hear otherwise about the price of CNT",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,12
350,n,16293,PMMA,Alright what were your specs for Rudy Hernandez?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,8
351,n,16294,PMMA,"We also will have to keep in mind how big of a difference the prices are obviously, the extra reliability may be worth the price",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25
350,n,16295,PMMA,That is true,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3
350,n,16296,PMMA,Aright so on to our third desing,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7
350,n,16297,PMMA,design,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
351,n,16298,PMMA,"Steric Hindering, Dry jet and 4%?",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6
351,n,16299,PMMA,Thats what I'm thinking look at it right now,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9
350,n,16300,PMMA,I jumped ship a little bit here and went no surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,11
352,n,16301,PMMA,Which consultant is this one for?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,6
350,n,16302,PMMA,Rudy Hernandez,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2
352,n,16303,PMMA,"Ok I had dry-jet wet, negative charge and 4%",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9
350,n,16304,PMMA,So the suractant is what we need to figure out,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,10
351,n,16305,PMMA,I personally think marketability is more important than cost here. especially since no surfactant doesnt perform well in general,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19
350,n,16306,PMMA,My reasoning behind none here was just the insanely low price per unit she gave out which is impossible to reach with any surfactat. I do agree though it is less marketable,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,32
350,n,16307,PMMA,Was the Negative Charge marketable?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,5
350,n,16308,PMMA,"I know the Steric Hindering was, but it also costs quite a bit",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,13
352,n,16309,PMMA,Yeah. I dont think surfactant matters as much on this one. I agree with Will. I think the 4% CNT will make it marketable enough without surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,27
351,n,16310,PMMA,Negative chare is twice as marketable as no surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9
351,n,16311,PMMA,But is 200$ more,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4
350,n,16312,PMMA,How much is the cost difference? because it its not twice as expensive then it might be worth it,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,1,0,6,19
351,n,16313,PMMA,and Steric is almost twice as marketable as negative charge but its only 50$ more,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15
350,n,16314,PMMA,So then we should probably go either no surfactant or Steric Hindering,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,12
352,n,16315,PMMA,It sounds like she's really strict on the pricing though,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,10
351,n,16316,PMMA,Steric hindering is almost 5 times more marketable then no surfactant but is only 3.5 times more expensive,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18
350,n,16317,PMMA,Oh damn now this is a hard choice,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8
350,n,16318,PMMA,Im honestly open for either design.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
350,n,16319,PMMA,Because either way we kind of meet her expecations we cant fully meet both,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,14
351,n,16320,PMMA,"One question, in our surfactant data, is the marketability score based at all on price.  Like when people said they would buy that one, did they think about the price?",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,30
352,n,16321,PMMA,"Ok if you go back to the original requests by the consultants, Rudy mentions only the inclusion of CNT towards her goal of marketability",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,24
351,n,16322,PMMA,Because if people said they would buy steric hindering knowing it would be more expensive it seems like an easy choice,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,21
350,n,16323,PMMA,Yes I agree then it kind of does besides that we do want  to reach her goal of price either way,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,21
350,n,16324,PMMA,I agree with both,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4
351,n,16325,PMMA,Yeah I guess our choice is if we want to meet the cost requirement or marketability requirement in a big way.,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21
350,n,16326,PMMA,Exactly,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
349,n,16327,PMMA,They are connected. Cost is a factor in marketability. But marketability is a projected estimate of how the product will do on the market. So there are other factors that influence it as well.,3,Mentor,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,34
350,n,16328,PMMA,So we literally cannot meet her goal,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7
352,n,16329,PMMA,No but we can get as close as possible,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9
350,n,16330,PMMA,I keep seeing in all these how marketable the nanotubes are but we never get any data on it,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,19
350,n,16331,PMMA,That would be helpful,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4
351,n,16332,PMMA,I would say lets keep cost down with the surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,10
350,n,16333,PMMA,Alright I can post my notebook after in the shared area,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,11
352,n,16334,PMMA,So no surfactant then?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,4
351,n,16335,PMMA,We can make the product more marketable through the no surfactant,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11
352,n,16336,PMMA,I agree,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2
350,n,16337,PMMA,Alright so dry jet No surfactant and 4%?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,8
351,n,16338,PMMA,Yeah,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
352,n,16339,PMMA,Yes,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
350,n,16340,PMMA,We can always change it later if we get some more marketiblity info,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,13
350,n,16341,PMMA,Okay,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
350,n,16342,PMMA,Onto the fourth prototype,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4
351,n,16343,PMMA,Ok perfect,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2
352,n,16344,PMMA,How about for Padma Rao?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,5
350,n,16345,PMMA,"I had Phase, biological surfactant, and 4%",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7
352,n,16346,PMMA,I had the same,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4
351,n,16347,PMMA,I agree,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2
350,n,16348,PMMA,Alright that will be our fourth,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
352,n,16349,PMMA,Yeah,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
350,n,16350,PMMA,For my fifth for  Michelle Proctor I had Phase Hydrophillic Surfactant and 4%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,13
352,n,16351,PMMA,"Yep, I had the same for her as well",3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9
351,n,16352,PMMA,I agree,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2
350,n,16353,PMMA,Alright so that will be our five then,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8
351,n,16354,PMMA,Do we know if a higher CNT% is more expensive?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,10
350,n,16355,PMMA,My only hope is that we can change them later as i truly feel the Steric Hindering is a great surfactant it just fit in none of their expectations,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,29
349,n,16356,PMMA,No. You may want to design prototypes to find out the effect of CNT% on cost.,3,Mentor,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,16
351,n,16357,PMMA,Yeah we should be able to change it up a bit to try different options,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,15
350,n,16358,PMMA,Do we want to use 2% on our second one?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,10
351,n,16359,PMMA,Lets try on Rudy and Alan,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6
352,n,16360,PMMA,It might be a good idea to,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7
351,n,16361,PMMA,They're the two who care most about cost,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8
350,n,16362,PMMA,Okay lets do 2% on Rudy and how many on Alan?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,11
352,n,16363,PMMA,Yeah I agree. We can always bring it back up later when we know more about how much it affects cost,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,21
351,n,16364,PMMA,I would say 2% makes the most sense for now,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,10
351,n,16365,PMMA,It keeps performance up and we can still see if its a factor,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13
350,n,16366,PMMA,Do we want to do a different % to see the price difference there as well,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,16
350,n,16367,PMMA,like 1 or 3?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,4
351,n,16368,PMMA,I guess lets try 1%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5
350,n,16369,PMMA,Alright so 2 for Rudy and 1 for Alan>,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,9
350,n,16370,PMMA,?,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,1

356,n,16765,PSF,2% it is,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3
357,n,16766,PSF,"the percentage for my consultant was 1.5 since it offered high flux and the lowest cost per unit of flux, making it the most cost effective",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,26

357,n,16769,PSF,2% would work as well if we are trying to find a compromise,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,13
355,n,16770,PSF,I think 2% would be better because the small increase results in a large increase in reliability,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,17
355,n,16771,PSF,"but yes, we can do 1.5 on another model",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9

354,n,16794,PSF,I agree. And are we using phase as our process?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,10
355,n,16795,PSF,"yes mitchell. and andrew, we identified it as a good compromise option in the surfactant discussion and it came up in several of our individual prototypes",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,26

355,n,16797,PSF,Then for our fifth prototype should we use vapor or dry-jet wet?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,12
354,n,16798,PSF,I say Dry-wet jet,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4

353,n,16801,PSF,"But, what do you guys want the second one to be?",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,7,11
355,n,16802,PSF,"I don't think any of our ptototypes would be vapor, then",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,11
357,n,16803,PSF,i agree with marshall,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4
355,n,16804,PSF,and the second one is nanotube 1.5%,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
353,n,16805,PSF,Do we need to examine each process? Maybe if we just stick with the most popular one. we can just create nanotubes with those processes,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,7,25
353,n,16806,PSF,"Same nanotube, just changing the percentage?",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,7,6

354,n,16809,PSF,We need to create 5 different prototypes. I dont think all 5 should be almost identical. We need to make them differ in more than 1 aspect,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,27
353,n,16810,PSF,"We can change surfactants to, but then were testing multiple variables at once and we dont know which varibale caused one nanotube to become better then the other",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,28

355,n,16812,PSF,"I think andrew may be confused. the process is how the artificial membrane is created, the nanotube percent is how much carbon nanotubes are infused into the membrane. there is only one kind of nanotube",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,35
357,n,16813,PSF,definitely differ CNT% and surfactant,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5

356,n,16815,PSF,So we are gonna go for overall difference and change instead of small adjustments?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,14

353,n,16817,PSF,"Yes, that is what I was leaning towards too....",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9
354,n,16818,PSF,I think that is the best way. Then when we get the results for each prototype we can make a single design that incorporates all of the things that worked well,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,31
353,n,16819,PSF,"Yes, that is a good idea",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6

377,o,18128,PMMA,My Insider wanted better blood cell reactivity but none of the processes were necessarily ideal,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,15
375,o,18129,PMMA,For mine Vapor was the best choice,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7

373,o,18131,PMMA,ok and for mine it was between vapor and dry jet but there was a minimal difference,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17
375,o,18132,PMMA,Okay so we have pmma steric negative and between 1-2%,3,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10

367,o,18299,PSF,"Based on your surfactant graph, how did the surfactants perform relative to one another?",4,Mentor,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,14
378,o,18300,PSF,I found that steric hindering was the most effective surfactant because it had the highest average desirability rating of all surfactants,4,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,21
381,o,18301,PSF,"I also believe that steric hindering was the best surfactant, next to biological, because it was also more cost effective.",4,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,20

382,o,18305,PSF,Based on my graph I also picked the Steric Hindering because it had the highest score. The next best score was the Hydrophilic.,4,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,23
378,o,18306,PSF,There couldn't be a surfactant that preformed well in all areas due to the fact that each surfactant had and extremely low flux rating,4,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,24

379,o,18309,PSF,"No, since all the surfactants had the same flux rate it was impossible for one particular surfactant to preform well for every category.",4,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,23

381,o,18321,PSF,"I took into account the flux rate since that helps to determine how long the patient will be on the machine, the beta-thromboglobulin level after two hours because the lower it is the better the patient feels, and lastly the cost to produce the surfactant for the membrane.",4,Player,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,0,0,0,1,1,0,5,48

381,o,18384,PSF,okay so what if we used Vapor vs. Dry-jet wet for the two processes because those were the two most cost effective in our research we were given,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,28
378,o,18385,PSF,yes that sounds good,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4

381,o,18389,PSF,"I'm fine with that, but then I think our fourth prototype should follow the exact same specifications but change the surfactant to hydrophilic to test its affects since it seems like we used either steric or hydrophilic in our prototypes",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,1,0,5,40
378,o,18390,PSF,and then the fifth would be with a steric hindering surfactant,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,11
381,o,18391,PSF,Should we try raising the CNT % on the fifth as well?,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,12

381,o,18393,PSF,"so the third is tyler's #2, then our fourth is the same specifications with hydrophilic, and then the fifth is tyler's #2 again with a higher CNT %?  is that right? and what % should we try? I'm thinking maybe 4 or 6%",4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,1,0,1,0,5,43
382,o,18394,PSF,We should test a couple at 1.5% i think because at that percentage we have the highest flux rating. Then we can change a different factor to see how it affects that,4,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,32

384,o,18707,PAM,I think we should slightly alter each spec and then maybe focus slightly more on one of them,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,18
387,o,18708,PAM,So our prime focus would be the CNT %. And that might be a good idea Brian.,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,17

383,o,18716,PAM,I feel like we should decide what our constant is,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,10

383,o,18718,PAM,weather its CNT or the manufaturing process,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7
386,o,18719,PAM,so do we all agree that its the CNT percentages that we want to alter. The rest stays pretty much constant?,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,21
387,o,18720,PAM,Yes definitely,5,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2

389,o,18979,PESPVP,I think a good start would be if everyone stated which prototype of theirs they feel the most confident in.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,20
390,o,18980,PESPVP,I'm most confident in my first prototype because it has high performance aspects but also has a relatively low cost.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,20
392,o,18981,PESPVP,"I was definitely most confident in my prototype which used a Steric Hindering surfactant, 20% nanotubule concentration and the phase inversion manufacturing process. I feel performance wise this, while expensive, could perform very well.",6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,34
393,o,18982,PESPVP,I agree that we should pursue using the steric hindering surfactant.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,11
393,o,18983,PESPVP,"We all agree that it is the best surfactant, and therefore have no need of testing other methods",6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,18
391,o,18984,PESPVP,Before I say which one I think my best is I have a question! If a surfactant was lacking in one area then can a different process CNT% make up for that area? Or is that not a possibility?,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,39
389,o,18985,PESPVP,So we need to submit five prototypes so I think four should be using the steric hindering and one another to see the effects of using a different surfactant.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,29
393,o,18986,PESPVP,agreed,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1
391,o,18987,PESPVP,does my question make any sense?,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,6
392,o,18988,PESPVP,I have the same question as Ellen does anyone know the answer to this?,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,14
389,o,18989,PESPVP,I'm not sure I was wondering the same thing Ellen,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,10
393,o,18990,PESPVP,Sort of. Thats what we are testing i think. To see if additional CNT values make a positive impact.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,19
389,o,18991,PESPVP,So what does everyone believe is the best manufacturing process and CNT value that goes with the steric hindering surfactant,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,1,0,7,20
391,o,18992,PESPVP,"Because I would pick my prototype 4. I picked hydrophilic because it has great reliability with a great cost. The nanotube percent is 20% because combined with hydrophilic surfactant fouling will not be as common. But  with this 20% the flux will be high allowing the process to be faster. So in all this product will be fast, reliable, cost efficient and middle of the line for blood cell reactivity.",6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,1,0,0,1,0,5,70
391,o,18993,PESPVP,But I agree that steric hinderance is the best if you cannot combine factors together.,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,15
393,o,18994,PESPVP,I would like to test me 4th prototype. It would be smart to put this in the batch so that we can test the flux reliability and rates with a CNT value of 6. We might not need to overkill it with 20%,6,Player,Team designs batch using 1 material,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,43
